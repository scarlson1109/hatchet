# Alternate Paths

## The Wanderer's Choice

[EVENT: awakening]
darkness. cold seeps in. only embers remain.
a choice: feed the fire or let it die.

[EVENT: fire_dies]
fire fades to nothing. warmth becomes memory.
wanderer steps into darkness. never to return.
the room grows cold. another story ends.

[EVENT: fire_lives]
flames rise. warmth returns.
light spills from windows, out into the dark.
but light draws eyes. movement in the shadows.

## The Nomad's Path

[EVENT: builder_rejection]
stranger stands by the fire. offers help. speaks of walls and shelter.
wanderer turns away. walls mean chains. fire dies behind.

[MECHANIC: nomad]
each dawn brings new horizon. each dusk new shelter.
no village grows. no walls rise.
the path stretches endless into waste.

[EVENT: nomad_encounters]
a gaunt man approaches, a crazed look in his eye
the grass thrashes wildly as a huge lizard pushes through
a soldier opens fire from across the desert

## The Builder's Path

[EVENT: builder_acceptance]
the stranger is standing by the fire. she says she can help. says she builds things.
wood becomes walls. walls become shelter.
others will come.

[MECHANIC: village]
a weathered family takes up in one of the huts.
a small group arrives, all dust and bones.
the town's booming. word does get around.

[EVENT: village_threats]
a sickness is spreading through the village.
medicine is needed immediately.
the nights are rent with screams.

## The Warlord's Rise

[EVENT: military_focus]
well armed men charge out of the forest, firing into the crowd.
after a skirmish they are driven away, but not without losses.
weapons gleam in firelight.

[MECHANIC: conquest]
the soldier steps out from between the buildings, rifle raised.
warfare is bloodthirsty.
village walls grow high.

[EVENT: battle_outcomes]
predators become prey. price is unfair.
the fight is short and bloody, but the beasts are repelled.
the villagers retreat to mourn the dead.

## The Seeker's Journey

[EVENT: ship_discovery]
the remains of a huge ship are embedded in the earth.
deeper into the ship, the darkness seems almost to writhe.
ancient secrets wait in shadow.

[MECHANIC: exploration]
the air is cooler here. low cabinets ring the room, doors dusted with frost.
samples of something biological inside.
the air in this room has a metallic tinge.

[EVENT: revelation]
scraps of copper wire litter the floor.
must have been the engine room, once.
the massive machines now stand inert, twisted and scorched by explosions.

## Hidden Paths

[EVENT: wasteland_secrets]
rotting reeds rise out of the swampy earth.
a lone frog sits in the muck, silently.
a swamp festers in the stagnant air.

[MECHANIC: discovery]
the mouth of the cave is wide and dark.
can't tell what's inside.
the earth here is split, as if bearing an ancient wound.

[EVENT: final_choice]
the towers that haven't crumbled jut from the landscape like the ribcage of some ancient beast.
might be things worth having still inside.
each path leads to different end.
