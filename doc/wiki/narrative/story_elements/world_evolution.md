[THEME: decay_and_discovery]
a dying world reveals its secrets.
each step uncovers history's shadow.

## Village Origins

the rickety cart will carry more wood from forest.

[EVENT: growth_begins]

now nomads have place to set up shop.

## Settlement Development
[MECHANIC: production]
tannery goes up quick, on edge of village.

workshop's finally ready. builder's excited to get to it.

[EVENT: industrial_rise]
haze falls over village as steelworks fires up.
armoury's done, welcoming back weapons of past.
villagers could make steel, given tools.

## Terrain Transformation
[MECHANIC: environment]
the trees yield to dry grass. yellowed brush rustles in wind.
the grasses thin. soon, only dust remains.
the trees are gone. parched earth and blowing dust are poor replacements.

[EVENT: biome_shift]
the barrens break at sea of dying grass, swaying in arid breeze.
trees loom on horizon. grasses yield to forest floor of dry branches.
a wall of gnarled trees rises from dust. branches twist into skeletal canopy.

## Trade Evolution

mysterious wanderer returns, cart piled high with wood.
trading post would make commerce easier.

another comes seeking furs, offering same.
old wanderer arrives, smiling warmly, asking for lodging.

## Combat Evolution

sword is sharp. good protection out in wilds.
black powder and bullets, like old days.

[EVENT: battle_progression]
a soldier opens fire from across desert.
a shot rings out from somewhere in long grass.
plasma rifles discharge in darkness.

## Resource Management
[MECHANIC: survival]
this waterskin'll hold bit of water, at least.
the cask holds enough water for longer expeditions.
never go thirsty again with water tank.

[EVENT: scarcity]
the meat has run out.
there is no more water.
starvation sets in.

## Technology Progression
[MECHANIC: advancement]
compass guides through wasteland.
energy cells power ancient weapons.
alien alloy gleams with possibility.

[EVENT: technological_discovery]

familiar hum of wanderer machinery coming to life.
somewhere above debris cloud, wanderer fleet hovers.

## Special Locations
[MECHANIC: exploration]
an old iron mine sits here, tools abandoned.
a huge hole cut deep into earth, evidence of past harvest.
a crashed starship lies silent, its hull gleaming dully.

a ruined city sprawls beneath grey sky.
a murky swamp festers in stagnant air.
