# a dark room: the complete story

## chapter 1: awakening

darkness. cold seeps in. only embers remain. the room is freezing, the fire is dead, and the wind howls outside. in this moment of desperation, the fire flickers, desperate for fuel. a choice presents itself – feed the fire, or let it die. warmth has a cost, but survival demands it.

through the gloom, a ragged stranger stumbles through the door. she's got a crazed look in her eye, mumbling words that are unintelligible through violent shivers. she huddles by the fire, hands trembling, says she can help. says she builds things. the builder, as she calls herself, grows warmer as the flames crackle to life once more. you're left with a rucksack, pockets almost empty, and a meager supply of wood. there's little else. but the builder whispers something about crafting, about gathering, about how each scrap of wood will matter.

the builder has been busy. walls rise from nothing, and the room grows warmer. wood becomes walls, walls become shelter. the stranger says she'll help, for now. others will come. the light from the fire spills from the windows, out into the dark while shadows dance on the walls. the night presses close, but inside, the room is warm now. wood is stacked by the fire, a barrier against the endless cold.

the night is long and cold, but the embers glow on. you feed the fire and watch the shadows recoil. builder says she can make traps to catch any creatures might still be alive out there. she points to a scrawled plan: "trap" – it might bring in meat and fur. your almost-empty supplies weigh on you. every scrap of wood has purpose. there's no better option. outside, the wind howls, but in here, the slow build of survival begins.

## chapter 2: the forest's edge

the days pass in a blur of gathering wood and feeding the embers. eventually, a dusty path extends from your door, and you venture out. the sky is grey, and the wind blows relentlessly. with pockets nearly bare, you scavenge. each trip yields small bundles of wood, a bit of precious meat from traps set in the underbrush. sometimes, a snarling beast leaps out. you lash out, grip clumsy on a makeshift weapon, and the beast collapses. your hp slips, breath ragged, but you survive. one victory at a time is enough to keep going.

the cart is built, battered wheels ready to haul wood from deeper in the forest. a single trap becomes many. between hunts, you expand the settlement. the builder stands by the fire, examining your haul. "with enough resources," she says, "we can craft everything we need. better armour, better defences. next, a workshop." the workshop takes shape – spools of wire, lumps of metal, scraps of cloth. you store your gains carefully, the rucksack growing heavier. each day, you haul back more wood, more hides, more hope.

beyond the last of the trees, the grass thrashes wildly as a huge lizard pushes through. a gaunt man shuffles closer, a crazed look in his eye. you stay alert, easing your weapon up. the forest recedes, replaced by parched earth and blowing dust. a wasteland lurks ahead. but the builder urges you on. if you find coal, iron, anything to feed the steelworks, the settlement will prosper. your pockets fill with each step, though exhaustion creeps in.

## chapter 3: the wasteland

the village grows stronger. wanderers appear at your gates, drawn by the promise of shelter. you ration food, water, gather pelts, and salvage metal from the edges of the wasteland. the nights are rent with screams as strange beasts prowl the perimeter. scavengers draw close, hoping for an easy score. you see muzzle flashes in the darkness – a soldier opens fire from across the desert. bullets snap through the air as you huddle behind wooden barricades. bleak, but you hold firm.

"trap," "cart," "workshop," "steelworks," "armoury" – each new building strengthens your hold on survival. the steelworks fires up, choking the village with haze but gifting you steel. the armoury rises, welcoming bullets of a lost era. the builder murmurs about defensive structures, about advanced contraptions. the thirst gnaws at you; water is scarce. your hp dips in each battle, restored sometimes by a scrap of food or a meager gulp of water. still, you march, pockets stuffed with salvage, your rucksack nearly bursting.

beyond the village walls, the trees yield to dry grass, then only dust remains. a wall of gnarled trees rises, skeletal branches overhead. old coal mines and iron mines dot the horizon. a battered sign: "iron mine," barely legible. you gather scraps of metal and lug them back to feed the steelworks. bleached bones and rusted weapons litter the barrens. there's little refuge. each day is a choice – venture deeper, gather more, or fortify what you have.

## chapter 4: the ship

time passes, and the settlement thrives enough to push deeper into uncharted lands. you come across a massive hull, half-buried in the dust. "a crashed starship," the builder murmurs. scorched remains loom, twisted metal like a tombstone. debris piles form makeshift barricades, riddled with old bullet holes. behind one barricade, you find a few abandoned weapons, battered but functional. mindful of your weight limit, you add them to your inventory.

deeper into the ship, the darkness seems almost to writhe, thick sticky webbing covers the corridor walls. a small knapsack hangs from a cluster of webs, leftover supplies inside. scraps of copper wire litter the floor; two bedrolls are wedged into a corner. a half-finished machine sits abandoned, wires trailing from it like tangled veins. you salvage what you can. occasionally, you rest at your settlement, forging new equipment in the steelworks, storing ammo in the armoury. the builder references advanced modules: "maybe one day," she says.

further in, you pass a security checkpoint. defences are blown apart, edges scorched by laser fire. you continue onward, through containment cells battered by some catastrophic conflict. the corridor is haunted by silence. you scavenge a bit of ammo, some battered armour fragments. your rucksack weighs heavy, your mind heavier still.

## chapter 5: the revelation

an elevator shudders upward, rattling your nerves. the command deck flickers in faint emergency lights. the ship's logs speak of a dangerous cargo. this was a prison ship, carrying something that should never be released. the crash was no accident. old data scrolls across cracked screens: "some things should stay locked away."

beyond a sealed bulkhead, a small antechamber remains hauntingly intact. a strange device sits on the floor, looks important, samples of something biological inside. the builder knows the device when she sees it, takes it fast, doesn't ask where it came from. your mind drifts to the settlement, to the resources you still need, the water, the fire, the armaments. but the device hums with a quiet, foreboding power. "the device awaits," the logs say. "time grows short."

## chapter 6: the choice

at last, you stand on the threshold of a final decision. the crystal pulses brightly, then goes dark. "what's done cannot be undone," you recall from the logs. you think of the nights spent feeding the embers, of the cart piled high with wood, your hp battered in combat, restored by scraps of food or half-working medical contraptions. the builder stands beside you, device in hand, eyes flickering with possibilities.

outside, silence falls over the wasteland. the choice is made. there's no going back. some mysteries are better left buried in the wasteland. perhaps the device could remake the world, or ensure it stays broken. either way, you emerge from the ship carrying consequences you barely understand. the story began with embers and a stranger's helping hands. it ends here – or maybe it begins anew – with you and the device, and a barren world waiting for whatever comes next.
