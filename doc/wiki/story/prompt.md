# A Dark Room: Story Generation Prompt

## Context
You are tasked with writing the complete narrative of A Dark Room, a post-apocalyptic text-based game. This story should weave together survival, mystery, and revelation while maintaining the game's distinctive minimalist style.

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Authentic Voice
- Draw directly from game messages for authenticity
- Combine existing phrases in meaningful ways
- Never invent new terminology or break style

### 2. Sentence Structure
- Use lowercase throughout
- Omit quotation marks in all dialogue
- Often omit articles ("a", "the")
- Use present tense consistently
- Keep phrases short and impactful

### 3. Show Don't Tell Examples
AVOID telling:
```
enemies appear
villagers are dying
the ship is dangerous
```

INSTEAD show through action:
```
a snarling beast leaps out of the underbrush
the nights are rent with screams
deeper into the ship, the darkness seems almost to writhe
```

### 4. Environmental Storytelling Examples
Strong examples:
```
rotting reeds rise out of the swampy earth
the towers that haven't crumbled jut from the landscape like the ribcage of some ancient beast
dry brush and dead branches litter the forest floor
```

## Core Style Examples
The narrative must match these exact patterns:

1. Environmental Description:
```
rotting reeds rise out of the swampy earth.
a lone frog sits in the muck, silently.
a swamp festers in the stagnant air.
```

2. Character Moments:
```
the stranger is standing by the fire. she says she can help. says she builds things.
wood becomes walls. walls become shelter.
others will come.
```

3. Combat Encounters:
```
a snarling beast leaps out of the underbrush.
the fight is short and bloody, but the beasts are repelled.
the villagers retreat to mourn the dead.
```

4. Discovery Moments:
```
the remains of a huge ship are embedded in the earth.
deeper into the ship, the darkness seems almost to writhe.
ancient secrets wait in shadow.
```

## Story Structure

### Section Format
Each story section should follow this pattern:

```
[LOCATION: name]
environmental description line
immediate situation line
implied future or consequence line

[EVENT: type]
action or discovery line
immediate consequence line
future implication line
```

### Example Section:
```
[LOCATION: village]
fire draws wanderers.
huts rise from nothing.
town grows in wasteland.

[EVENT: village_growth]
a weathered family takes up in one of the huts.
a small group arrives, all dust and bones.
the town's booming. word does get around.
```

## Progression Framework
Follow this exact sequence, maintaining atmosphere and mystery throughout:

1. [START]
   - darkness. cold seeps in. only embers remain.
   - First choice: feed fire or let it die
   - Builder arrival and first shelter

2. [EARLY]
   - Forest exploration and resource gathering
   - First encounters with danger
   - Village beginnings

3. [MID]
   - Expansion into wasteland
   - Resource management and survival
   - Growing threats and discoveries

4. [LATE]
   - Ancient technology discovery
   - Military encounters
   - World mysteries deepen

5. [END]
   - Final revelations
   - Truth about the world
   - Ultimate choice

## Required Elements

### Environmental Storytelling
Use these techniques:
1. Weather and atmosphere:
```
the sky is grey and the wind blows relentlessly
dry brush and dead branches litter the forest floor
```

2. Location description:
```
broken streetlights stand rusting. light hasn't graced this place in a long time
the towers that haven't crumbled jut from the landscape like the ribcage of some ancient beast
```

### Character Development
Show through actions and consequences:
```
builder says she can make traps to catch any creatures might still be alive out there
won't say from where he came, but it's clear that he's not staying
```

### Resource Impact
Demonstrate through environment and consequences:
```
the room is freezing. the fire is dead
water turns bitter. fever claims the weak
```

## Story Branches
Include alternative paths naturally within the main narrative:
```
[CHOICE: builder_arrival]
stranger stands by the fire. offers help. speaks of walls and shelter.
- accept: wood becomes walls. walls become shelter. others will come
- reject: wanderer turns away. walls mean chains. fire dies behind
```

## Writing Guidelines

- Build tension through discovery
- Let mystery drive the narrative
- Use terse, impactful phrases

### DON'T
